#prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 
# that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 
# A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. 
#For example, 
# 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, ARE 1 Ã— 5 or 5 Ã— 1, involve 5 itself. 
# However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 Ã— 2) in which both numbers are 
# smaller than 4.

# "A PRIME NUMBER IS ONLY DIVISIBLE BY 1 OR ITSELF."
